Some files for my AQUA project that are on my local machine.

Files include:

- scripts to create initial conditions
- some messy scripts to look at some output

Note: to run symcore.py, download the CORE Corrected Normal Year forcing version 2.0 from https://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/nomads/forms/core/COREv2/CNYF_v2.html and modify the path to this data in symcore.py
